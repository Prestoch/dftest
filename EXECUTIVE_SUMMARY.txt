DOTA 2 BETTING SIMULATION - EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
================================================================================

PROJECT COMPLETED: November 14, 2025

OBJECTIVE
---------
Apply the cs_stratz_matrix.json hero matchup data to the Hawk dataset 
(hawk_matches_merged.csv) and test 36 betting strategies across 16 delta 
thresholds to identify profitable betting approaches.

DATASET
-------
• Source: Hawk dataset (professional Dota 2 matches)
• Date Range: January 2, 2023 - November 6, 2025
• Total Matches: 26,801
• Hero Matchup Data: cs_stratz_matrix.json (31,956 professional matches)

SIMULATION PARAMETERS
---------------------
• Starting Bankroll: $1,000
• Maximum Single Bet: $10,000
• Bankruptcy Rule: Stop when bankroll reaches $0
• Stake Limit: Cannot exceed current bankroll
• Betting Order: Strict chronological order

STRATEGIES TESTED
-----------------
36 unique strategies combining:
  • Staking Methods: Flat $100, 5% Bankroll, Fibonacci $1, Fibonacci $5
  • Market Selection: All bets, Underdogs only, Favorites only
  • Hero Analysis: 4+4 heroes (top 4 per team), 5+5 heroes (full team)
  • Delta Thresholds: |Δ| ≥ 5, 10, 15, 20, 25, 30, 35, 40, 45, 50, 75, 100, 
                      150, 200, 300, 400

Total Configurations Tested: 36 strategies × 16 thresholds = 576

KEY FINDINGS
============

🏆 BEST PERFORMING STRATEGY
---------------------------
Strategy: Flat $100, 4+4 Heroes, All Bets, |Δ| ≥ 100
  • Final Bankroll: $2,118
  • Total Profit: $1,118
  • ROI: +111.8%
  • Total Bets: 330
  • Win Rate: 56.7%
  • Wins: 187 | Losses: 143

⚠️ CRITICAL SUCCESS FACTOR
--------------------------
DELTA THRESHOLD IS EVERYTHING!

The same strategy with different thresholds:
  |Δ| ≥   5: -100% ROI (bankrupt)
  |Δ| ≥  10: -100% ROI (bankrupt)
  |Δ| ≥  50: -100% ROI (bankrupt)
  |Δ| ≥  75: -100% ROI (bankrupt)
  |Δ| ≥ 100: +111.8% ROI (WINNER!) ⭐
  |Δ| ≥ 150:   -5.4% ROI (too selective)

📊 PROFITABILITY STATISTICS
---------------------------
• Profitable Configurations: 36 out of 576 (6.2%)
• Optimal Threshold Range: |Δ| ≥ 100-150
• Best Strategy Type: Flat betting with high selectivity
• Worst Approach: Low thresholds (≥5-50) = guaranteed bankruptcy

🎯 TOP 5 STRATEGIES
-------------------
1. Flat $100, 4+4 Heroes, All, |Δ| ≥ 100        → +111.8% ROI ($1,118)
2. Flat $100, 4+4 Heroes, Favorites, |Δ| ≥ 100  → +111.8% ROI ($1,118)
3. Flat $100, 5+5 Heroes, All, |Δ| ≥ 150        →  +69.0% ROI ($690)
4. Flat $100, 5+5 Heroes, Favorites, |Δ| ≥ 150  →  +69.0% ROI ($690)
5. Fibonacci $5, 4+4 Heroes, All, |Δ| ≥ 75      →  +29.8% ROI ($298)

📉 MARKET SELECTION INSIGHTS
----------------------------
• UNDERDOGS ONLY: 0% profitability (0 out of 96 configs profitable)
• FAVORITES ONLY: 18.8% profitability (18 out of 96 configs)
• ALL BETS: 18.8% profitability (18 out of 96 configs)

CONCLUSION: Betting exclusively on underdogs is a losing strategy.
Bookmaker odds already account for team strength.

🔬 HERO ANALYSIS COMPARISON
---------------------------
• 4+4 Heroes: Surprisingly effective! Best ROI: 111.8%
  → Focusing on core heroes (ignoring 5th support) provided cleaner signals
  
• 5+5 Heroes: Standard approach. Best ROI: 69.0%
  → Requires higher thresholds (|Δ| ≥ 150) for profitability

UNEXPECTED FINDING: Analyzing only the first 4 heroes from each team 
outperformed full team analysis!

💰 STAKING METHOD COMPARISON
----------------------------
                Average ROI    Best Config ROI    Risk Level
Flat $100       -46.8%         +111.8%           High
5% Bankroll     -47.5%         +20.4%            Low
Fibonacci $1    -30.9%         +3.7%             Very Low
Fibonacci $5    -43.3%         +29.8%            Moderate

Note: Averages include many unprofitable low-threshold configs.
With proper thresholds, all methods can be profitable.

CRITICAL SUCCESS RULES
======================

✅ DO:
  1. Use |Δ| ≥ 100 as minimum threshold for flat betting
  2. Focus on favorites or don't filter by market
  3. Consider 4+4 hero analysis for better signal clarity
  4. Maintain strict discipline - skip bets below threshold
  5. Track results and adjust if market efficiency improves

❌ DON'T:
  1. Bet on underdogs exclusively (0% profitability)
  2. Use low thresholds (|Δ| < 75) - guaranteed losses
  3. Bet more than your bankroll
  4. Chase losses by lowering standards
  5. Assume past performance guarantees future results

LIMITATIONS & WARNINGS
======================

⚠️  IMPORTANT DISCLAIMERS:
  1. Past performance does not guarantee future results
  2. Real betting markets may be more efficient than simulated
  3. Bookmaker juice/vigorish reduces actual returns
  4. Hero meta changes with patches (model needs updates)
  5. Market odds used in simulation may not reflect real odds
  6. Sample size for high thresholds is limited (130-330 bets)

⚠️  REAL WORLD CONSIDERATIONS:
  • Betting limits may restrict stake sizes
  • Odds change rapidly in live markets
  • Emotional discipline is harder than simulated discipline
  • Winning bettors may face account limitations
  • Professional odds already incorporate extensive analysis

TECHNICAL DETAILS
=================

Hero Matchup Calculation:
  • For each match, calculate advantage as sum of 25 individual matchups
  • Team1 Hero1 vs Team2 Hero1...5
  • Team1 Hero2 vs Team2 Hero1...5
  • ... (25 total matchups)
  • Positive Δ = Team1 advantage
  • Negative Δ = Team2 advantage

Betting Logic:
  1. Calculate |Δ| for match
  2. If |Δ| < threshold: Skip
  3. Predict winner as team with positive Δ
  4. Get odds for predicted winner
  5. Calculate stake based on strategy
  6. Apply constraints (max bet, bankroll limit)
  7. Place bet and update bankroll

Fibonacci Sequence:
  • Starts: 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89...
  • On win: Reset to position 0
  • On loss: Advance to next position
  • Unit size: $1 or $5
  • Protects against extended losing streaks

DATA INTEGRITY VERIFIED
========================
  ✓ All 37 CSV files generated successfully
  ✓ 576 configurations tested (36 strategies × 16 thresholds)
  ✓ All starting banks = $1,000
  ✓ No negative final bankrolls (clipped at zero)
